# Testing Notes

## Live web smoke

The live web platform smoke runs the public built CLI against a local fixture page through the managed web backend:

```bash
AGENT_DEVICE_WEB_E2E=1 pnpm test:smoke:web
```

The test is skipped unless `AGENT_DEVICE_WEB_E2E=1` is set. The test runs `agent-device web setup` and `agent-device web doctor` with an isolated state directory before opening the fixture URL, so it verifies the public managed-backend setup path instead of relying on a global `agent-browser`. CI runs the lane on Node 24 because the managed backend requires Node >= 24. Failure artifacts, daemon state, and browser config are written under `test/artifacts/web/`.
