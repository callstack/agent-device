# Testing Notes

## Affected-check selector (`pnpm check:affected`)

`pnpm check:affected --base <ref>` derives which local checks a diff needs, so
agents stop interpreting the testing matrix by hand. It is a **fail-open
advisory**: existing GitHub CI stays authoritative and required, and this only
narrows the *local* feedback loop.

```sh
pnpm check:affected --base origin/main          # human-readable plan
pnpm check:affected --base origin/main --json    # stable machine-readable plan
pnpm check:affected --base origin/main --run      # also run the local checks
```

The selection is derived from repository sources of truth rather than a
hand-maintained path map:

- **Test ownership** comes from the Vitest project `include`/`exclude` globs in
  `vitest.config.ts`. A changed test file selects the project that owns it; a
  changed production `src/**` file selects the unit suite that mirrors it.
- **Always-on gates** (`lint`, `typecheck`, `layering`, `fallow`, `format`) fire
  for their input categories and are never silently skipped.
- **Commands** are resolved from real `package.json` scripts, so a renamed
  script fails loudly instead of dropping a gate.
- A **small explicit build-ownership layer** covers the paths whose owning build
  cannot be derived: Swift runner, Android helpers, macOS helper, MCP metadata,
  and the public package surface (itself derived from `package.json` `exports`).
- **SkillGym ownership** covers skill guidance (`skills/`) and the SkillGym
  harness (`test/skillgym/`) — those changes select the (local-only) SkillGym
  suite, and their Markdown is treated as skill/harness input, not inert docs.

Changed-file discovery folds working-tree state into the local plan: in the
default local mode (`--head HEAD`) it unions the committed `base..HEAD` diff with
staged, unstaged, and untracked files, and disables rename detection so **both**
sides of a rename are classified (a moved file cannot look docs-only by its
destination alone).

Anything the selector cannot classify — unknown, ambiguous, workflow/tooling, or
a change to the selector's own sources — **fails open to the full check set**.
The plan documents the rule and changed path behind every selected check.

Model and catalog live under `scripts/check-affected/`; the derivation is guarded
by `pnpm check:affected:test` (the `Affected-check Selector` CI job).

## Live web smoke

The live web platform smoke runs the public built CLI against a local fixture page through the managed web backend:

```bash
AGENT_DEVICE_WEB_E2E=1 pnpm test:smoke:web
```

The test is skipped unless `AGENT_DEVICE_WEB_E2E=1` is set. The test runs `agent-device web setup` and `agent-device web doctor` with an isolated state directory before opening the fixture URL, so it verifies the public managed-backend setup path instead of relying on a global `agent-browser`. CI runs the lane on Node 24 because the managed backend requires Node >= 24. Failure artifacts, daemon state, and browser config are written under `test/artifacts/web/`.

## Speed rules (experiment-backed, 2026-07-04)

Measured on the full unit suite (340 files, 3,210 tests, 48s wall at ~7x parallelism):

- **Wall clock equals the slowest file.** The 44.6s android monolith bounded the whole 48s run
  (Amdahl at file granularity: vitest parallelizes per file). Splitting monolith test files is a
  wall-clock optimization, not just a navigation one — see the AGENTS.md test-topology mirror rule.
- **Unit tests must not wait real time.** The suite's worst tests slept through production budgets:
  10.8s to prove "times out" by waiting out the full constant, 8s emulator-boot polls at 1Hz, real
  retry backoffs. Conversion patterns, in preference order (tracking issue #1098):
  1. *Budget-derived cadence* (production-legit): poll intervals scale with the caller's timeout —
     this took `devices.test.ts` from 25.6s to 2.8s (9x) while making short-budget production calls
     more responsive.
  2. *Budget-wiring assertion*: don't re-prove the exec layer's timeout per call site; mock the tool
     layer and assert the right `timeoutMs` constant is passed. Exec-layer timeout semantics are
     proven once, in exec's own tests.
  3. *Fake clocks* where the code accepts an injected clock.
  Never add a test-only DI seam for this — the CI gate forbids it; patterns 1–2 are production
  improvements and test restructurings respectively.
- **The slow-test ratchet** (`scripts/vitest-slow-test-reporter.ts`) enforces this: unit budget
  2.5s, integration 15s, failure at 2x budget (the band between reports without failing — host
  load legitimately stretches borderline tests, and a flaky gate trains people to ignore it).
  The pin list only shrinks, or grows in the same PR with a justification.
- **Isolation stays ON; pool stays forks — both measured.** `--no-isolate`: 205s wall vs 48s
  (module state — timers, memos, singletons — thrashes across files sharing a worker).
  `--pool=threads`: no change (50.4s). The ~100s aggregate import overhead is the price of
  isolation and is paid in parallel; reduce it per file by importing the module under test, not
  platform barrels.
